# regTPS-KLE: A novel approach to approximate a Gaussian random field for Bayesian spatial modeling

### Abstract: regTPS-KLE is a new method for modeling spatial data under Bayesian inference. The method uses regularized thin plate splines with Karhunen-Loève Expansion to approximate Gaussian random fields.
