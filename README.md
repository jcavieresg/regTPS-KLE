# regTPS-KLE: A novel approach to approximate a Gaussian random field for Bayesian spatial modeling

This a new method for modeling spatial data under Bayesian inference. The method uses regularized thin plate splines with Karhunen-Loève Expansion to approximate Gaussian random fields. All the models are implemenrted in R and using Template Model Builder (TMB) as principal software of modeling. The inference is done via the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm of Stan.
